        <h1>Where Perspective Meets Humor</h1>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="story active">
                <p>The pandemic shifted everything in my life. Like many others, I found myself adjusting to a world turned upside down: virtual classes, isolation from friends, and endless uncertainty. At first, I could handle it all. I always prided myself on being strong and resilient. But when I tested positive for COVID-19, I had no idea what was coming.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="story">
                <p>COVID-19 led to sepsis — a life-threatening complication. I was brushed off at a local hospital, and my mom was told, “If the situation gets worse, take him to Vanderbilt.” At the time, I was no longer positive for COVID-19, but the impact it had on me was still very prominent. My mom drove me to Vanderbilt a few days later when the situation, in fact, only got worse. I guess your kid telling you “Mom I am dying.” turns you into a NASCAR driver because the drive from Clarksville to Nashville felt like 3 minutes. I am sure she was going the speed limit, don’t worry.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="story">
                <p>I will never forget the 5 doctors who filled my room telling my mom, “He has sepsis; if you did not bring him in when you did, he would have died within the night.” I looked over at her and said, “I told you I was dying.” I guess it was to get a laugh out of her, but also, my coping mechanisms were not the best. In fact, comedy was the only one I used.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="story">
                <p>I had never heard of sepsis before that moment, but I would not wish it on my worst enemy. I lost my strength, my mental clarity, and even my basic abilities. I spent a week in the hospital on a floor very close to a helicopter pad, which was insanely loud (who would have thought). I realized how weak I had become, both physically and mentally. I couldn’t deny it when the doctors and therapists asked difficult questions about my mental health. I couldn’t lie about it; I did not have the energy. So, I told the truth, leading to a difficult but necessary decision. They put me on Lexapro to help manage my mental health and some anxiety medicine with far too many letters to make sense.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="story">
                <p>I asked my psychologist when I could go back to school, and they looked at me like I was insane; I was not sure why at the moment. My thought process was I would get better before I left the hospital. With all of the machines, medicine, and IVs they had me hooked up to, it made sense. SPOILER ALERT I was very wrong. My mom, along with the doctors, advised that it was best to medically withdraw and focus on getting better. I did argue with my mom and the doctors over it, but I, in fact, did not win.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="story">
                <p>Academics were everything to me. They were a big part of who I was. To me, school was not just about learning — it was about proving that I could be the best at everything I put my mind to. But now, here I was, physically and mentally weak, unable to even walk without assistance or remember basic details. I couldn’t spell my name. I didn’t recognize my younger siblings. I couldn’t remember anything about school. It was like I had become a stranger to myself.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="story">
                <p>It was devastating. I had worked so hard to get where I was, and now it felt like I was losing everything. How could I be the best if I wasn’t even in school anymore? How could I prove my worth if my academic achievements — the very thing that defined me — were suddenly out of reach? At that moment, I had to accept that I couldn’t continue with school right away. So, I took the step I never imagined I would: I medically withdrew from college.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="story">
                <p>The recovery process was long and difficult. It took three months of inpatient and outpatient therapy at Vanderbilt. It wasn’t just about regaining physical strength; I had to re-learn things I had once taken for granted — reading, walking, and seeing. That last one was terrifying. I could barely focus, and the fog in my memory was overwhelming. It felt like I was starting from scratch. I would get irritated easily because I could no longer do things I loved, like reading and writing. I felt trapped in myself.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="story">
                <p>Slowly, over the months, I began to regain my abilities. I re-learned how to walk, read, and remember the things I had once known so well. The fog in my mind lifted bit by bit. I started to remember my younger siblings. I could spell my name again. It was a slow process, but each small victory felt like a giant step forward.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="story">
                <p>During those months of therapy and recovery, I realized something I hadn’t fully understood: being the best isn’t just about academic achievement. It’s about perseverance. It’s about resilience. It’s about rising after setbacks, no matter how big or small. The road to recovery was not easy, and I had to let go of the idea that my worth was solely tied to my academic success.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="story">
                <p>I was a different person when I finally returned to school in the Spring of 2023. I had gained a new perspective that allowed me to appreciate the things that matter. Yes, academics were important to me, but my health, family, and resilience were even more important. I had learned that the glass wasn’t just half empty or half full; sometimes, it’s about accepting where you are in the moment and finding a way to move forward, no matter the challenges.</p>
